## Code Quality

- [x] Build, format, lint, typecheck — all clean
- [x] `noUncheckedIndexedAccess` enabled and passing

No outstanding issues. This project is the cleanest of the five.

## Potential Improvements

- [ ] **Bump Node engine** — Currently `>=20` in package.json but could target `>=22` once Node 22 becomes the active LTS line (October 2025+).
